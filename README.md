The project is divided in two folders, Client Side and Server Side. 

I have created a python script to init both projects just by running the script.

If the script does not work, please follow the instructions listed below:

	1) Open the server folder, open terminal, type node index.js and press enter (127.0.0.1, I am using Port 3001 for http requests and Port 3002 for socket IO)
	2) Open client folder, open terminal, type npm install and press enter (Installing dependecies).
	3) When it is done, type npm start and press enter
